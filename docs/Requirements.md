## Functional:
    1. Implemented Dijkstra's, Lee's, Ford-Bellman's, Floyd-Warshall's, A* (Astar), Johnson's algorithms,
    2. All common graph representations are supported: adjacency matrix, adjacency list, edge list
    3. For Lee's algorithm only rectangular bool 2d-array should be supported.
## Non-functional:
    4. Library should be easy to install (no more than 8 separate terminal commands after download)
    5. On any random graph with N vertices <= 10000 each algorithm should be computed in no more than 2 minutes.
